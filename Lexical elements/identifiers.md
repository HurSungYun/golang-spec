# Identifiers

Identifiers name program entities such as variables and types. An identifier is a sequence of one or more letters and digits. The first character in an identifier must be a letter.

<pre>
<a id="identifier">identifier</a> = [letter](/Source%20code%20representation/letters_and_digits.html#letter) { [letter](/Source%20code%20representation/letters_and_digits.html#letter) | [unicode_digit](/Source%20code%20representation/letters_and_digits.html#unicode_digit) } .
</pre>

Some identifiers are [predeclared](Declarations%20and%20scope/predeclared_identifiers.html).
