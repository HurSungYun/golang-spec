# Interface types

An interface type specifies a method set called its interface. A variable of interface type can store a value of any type with a method set that is any superset of the interface. Such a type is said to implement the interface. The value of an uninitialized variable of interface type is nil.

<pre>
InterfaceType      = "interface" "{" { MethodSpec ";" } "}" .
MethodSpec         = MethodName Signature | InterfaceTypeName .
MethodName         = identifier .
InterfaceTypeName  = TypeName .
</pre>

As with all method sets, in an interface type, each method must have a unique non-blank name.

// A simple File interface
interface {
	Read(b Buffer) bool
	Write(b Buffer) bool
	Close()
}
More than one type may implement an interface. For instance, if two types S1 and S2 have the method set

```
func (p T) Read(b Buffer) bool { return … }
func (p T) Write(b Buffer) bool { return … }
func (p T) Close() { … }
```

(where T stands for either S1 or S2) then the File interface is implemented by both S1 and S2, regardless of what other methods S1 and S2 may have or share.

A type implements any interface comprising any subset of its methods and may therefore implement several distinct interfaces. For instance, all types implement the empty interface:

```
interface{}
```

Similarly, consider this interface specification, which appears within a type declaration to define an interface called Locker:

```
type Locker interface {
	Lock()
	Unlock()
}
```

If S1 and S2 also implement

```
func (p T) Lock() { … }
func (p T) Unlock() { … }
```

they implement the Locker interface as well as the File interface.

An interface T may use a (possibly qualified) interface type name E in place of a method specification. This is called embedding interface E in T; it adds all (exported and non-exported) methods of E to the interface T.

```
type ReadWriter interface {
	Read(b Buffer) bool
	Write(b Buffer) bool
}

type File interface {
	ReadWriter  // same as adding the methods of ReadWriter
	Locker      // same as adding the methods of Locker
	Close()
}

type LockedFile interface {
	Locker
	File        // illegal: Lock, Unlock not unique
	Lock()      // illegal: Lock not unique
}
```

An interface type T may not embed itself or any interface type that embeds T, recursively.

```
// illegal: Bad cannot embed itself
type Bad interface {
	Bad
}

// illegal: Bad1 cannot embed itself using Bad2
type Bad1 interface {
	Bad2
}
type Bad2 interface {
	Bad1
}
```
